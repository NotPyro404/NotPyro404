## Hey!

I'm Pyro, a random dude on the internet working on projects that I suddenly get interested in.
I also do some content creation, not that I'm any good.

If you care, my pronouns are He/Him but I truly don't care what you use as long as I know you are referring to me.

### Things that I help out with/work on:
#### Town of Host Enhanced:
- [Website](tohre.dev) (Website Assistant)
- [Among Us Mod](https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced) (Admittedly very little)
